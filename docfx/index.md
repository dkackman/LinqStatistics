# Welcome to **LinqStatistics**

LinqStatistics is a .Net library that offers basic statistical extension methods. Method signatures and use are modeled after System.Linq
Average, Min, Max and Sum, with similar overloads supporting common intrinsic numeric types.

Methods include:

- Covariance
- Median
- Mode
- Pearson's Correlation Coefficient
- Range
- Single pass Min/Max
- Standard Deviation (sample and population)
- Variance (sample and population)
- Root Mean Square
- Least Squares Linear Regression
- CountEach
