# Welcome to **LinqStatistics**

LinqStatistics is a .Net library that offers basic statistical extension methods. Method signatures and use are modeled after System.Linq.Enumerable's
Average, Min, Max and Sum, with similar overloads supporting common intrinsic numeric types.

Methods include:

- Covariance
- Median
- Mode
- Pearson's Correlation Coefficient
- Range
- Single pass Min/Max
- Standard Deviation (sample and population)
- Variance (sample and population)
- Root Mean Square
- Least Squares Linear Regression
- CountEach
- Histogram

LinqStatistics isn't a high performance analysis package. It's meant for those times when your app just needs some simple stats without a lot of fuss.
